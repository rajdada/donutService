# Donut Queue

## Situation
Jim works in the production facility of a premium online donut retailer. He is responsible for bringing donuts to the pickup counter once they’re done. But the manager is not satisfied because either it takes too long before a delivery arrives, or only a few items arrive. Jim’s manager wants to fix this and asks Jim to write a web service that accepts the orders and provides a list of items to deliver to the pickup counter. Desperate Jim remembers his friend who is working in a software company as a software engineer ... and your phone rings. Can you help Jim?

## Problem Statement
Jim explains to you that he has a bunch of requirements for the priority queue and the web service. The constraints he was given are:

● The service should implement a RESTful interface

● All orders will be placed in a single queue

● Each order is comprised of the ID of the client and the requested quantity of donuts

● A client can only place one order and existing orders cannot be modified (only canceled)

● Client IDs are in the range of 1 to 20000 and customers with IDs less than 1000 are premium customers

● Orders are sorted by the number of seconds they are in the queue

● Orders from premium customers always have a higher priority than orders from regular customers

Jim is supposed to look at the queue every 5 minutes and bring as many orders to the pickup counter as possible. His cart holds up to 50 donuts and he should put as many orders into his cart as possible without skipping, changing, or splitting any orders.

## Requirements
This leads to the following list of requirements for the endpoints:

● An endpoint for adding items to the queue. This endpoint must take two parameters, the ID of the client and the quantity

● An endpoint for the client to check his queue position and approximate wait time. Counting starts at 1.

● An endpoint which allows his manager to see all entries in the queue with the approximate wait time

● An endpoint to retrieve his next delivery which should be placed in the cart

● An endpoint to cancel an order. This endpoint should accept only the client ID Endpoints should follow REST best practices. Parameters should be passed in the fashion that most closely aligns with REST principles.
